# Cornhacks-2025
---
This project is a collaborative project that allows users to create a personalized night sky experience where they can add stars to a virtual sky with customizable attributes, including brightness, size, color, and a personal wish. Built using **React** and **JavaScript (JSX)**, this interactive web app allows people to express their creativity and make their own night sky with meaningful touches.

## Features
- **Add Stars:** Users can click on the night sky to add stars.
- **Customizable Star Properties:**
  - **Brightness:** Adjust the brightness of each star.
  - **Size:** Choose the size of the stars.
  - **Color:** Select a color for the stars.
  - **Wish:** Write a personal wish for each star added.
- **Responsive:** The app adjusts to different screen sizes, so users can enjoy the night sky.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the interactive UI.
- **Javascript (JSX):** For writing the application logic.
- **CSS:** For styling the night sky, stars, and objects.
- **HTML5 Canvas:** To render the night sky and stars in a smooth, interactive manner.

## How It Works:
1. Adding Stars:
- Users can click anywhere on the canvas to add a star.
- The position of the star is based on the coordinates of the click.
2. Customizing Star Properties:
- Upon adding a star, a popup form will appear, allowing users to:
- Adjust the brightness.
- Select the size of the star from a range of options.
- Pick a color from a list.
- Write a personal wish for that specific star.
3. Rendering Stars:
- Each star is drawn on a canvas, and its attributes (size, brightness, color, and wish) are rendered dynamically.
4. CSS and Animation:
- CSS is used to style the background, make the night sky dark, and animate the stars.
JavaScript handles the animation and user interaction, updating the canvas as new stars are added.
